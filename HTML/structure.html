    <h1>This is the Main Heading</h1>
    <p>
        This text might be an introduction to the rest of the page.
        And if the page is a long one it might be split up into several
        sub-headings.
    </p>
    <h2>This is a Sub-Heading</h2>
    <p>
        Many long articles have sub-headings to help you follow the structure
        of what is being written. There may even be sub-sub-headings (or lower-level headings).
    </p>
</body>
</html>


<!-- NOTES:

    - Tags act like containers. They tell you something about the information that lies between their opening and closing tags.

    - The characters in the brackets indicate the tag's purpose. For example, in the tags above 'p' stands for 'paragraph'.

    - The opening <html> tag indicates that anything between it and a closing </html> tag is HTML code. The closing </html> tag
    indicates that it is the end of the HMTL code.

    - The <body> tag indicates that anything between it and the closing </body> tag should be shown inside the main browser window.
    The closing </body> tag indicates the end of what would appear in the main browser window.

    - Words between <h1> and </h1> are a main heading.

    - Words between <h2> and </h2> form a sub-heading.

    - Attributes provide additional information about the contents of an element. They appear on the opening tag of the element and
    are made up of 2 parts: a name and a value, separated by an equals sign. The attribute name should be written in lowercase and
    the value should be placed in double quotes. 
    
    (e.g.) <html lang="en"> 
        
    ^^ Here an attribute called 'lang' is used to indicate the language used in this element that all browsers understand. 
    
    - HTML5 allows you to use uppercase attribute names and omit the quotemarks, but this is not recommended.
